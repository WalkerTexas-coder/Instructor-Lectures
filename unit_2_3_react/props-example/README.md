The DOM is always listening for changes-- if I have screen with Hello world and an input and I add an "a" to the input that change to the "screen" is actually a change to the DOM. The DOM is always watching and listening for events like changes or clicks or hovers.

As developers, we can add event listeners to HTML (and JSX) tags that will wait for listen for events. Maybe thats adding an onClick to a Button or as we'll see today an onChange to an input field. 

Inputs have three arrtibutes that we need to know about

type - be it text or radio button
