Arrays 
[]
variables set arrays like this

[1,15,45,65,70]
[money, dinero, mula, yen, dolladollabillz]
INDEXS === [0,1,2,3,4,5...]
[i] is like an address for an array
so we can imagine an array looks like this 

                   i
                   0      1       2      3    4    5    6    7    8    9
var arrayRhyme = [enie, meanie, mineie, mo, catch, a, tiger, by, its, toe]

so arrayRhyme[0] === ______?
