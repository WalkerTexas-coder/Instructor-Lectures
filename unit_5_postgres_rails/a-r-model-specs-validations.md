Model specs and Validations 

Data is the core of any full-stack application. I've previously called it the money maker of our applications.In order to protect our data is to add validations. 

Validations are used to ensure that only the data we choose gets saved into the database. Rails will run all model validations before content is added to the database. If these validations produce any errors the content will not be saved.
